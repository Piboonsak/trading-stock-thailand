# Trading in SET

This repository collects my example codes in Python for studing in [The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET)](http://www.set.or.th/set/mainpage.do)

In file [indicator.py](indicator.py), there are my examples for compute the technical indicators for security including

`ROC, Bollinger Band (BBANDS), daily returns, SMA, EMA, MACD, RSI, Sharpe ratio,True Range (TR), ATR, Beta, OBV and etc`

I Borrowed some code from : 

* https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-for-trading--ud501
* http://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/finance_demo.

Use datasets (EOD data files from SET)
